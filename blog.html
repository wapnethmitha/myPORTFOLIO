                <p class="blog-text">
                    Playing the guitar and keyboard lets me explore different styles of music, from pop to classical. I often spend time practicing songs and experimenting with melodies. Singing is another passion of mine; I love to perform my favorite songs and create my own. It’s a great way to connect with others and share my feelings.

                <h2 class="blog-title">My Experience with a Plane Management System</h2>
                <time class="blog-date" datetime="2024-10-19">October 19, 2024</time>
                <p class="blog-text">
                    In my first year of coursework, I developed a plane management seat management system. This project was a great learning experience for me, as it helped me understand how to create a software application from scratch.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-text">
                    The system included features like booking seats, viewing the seat map, checking prices, and changing seats. I built it using Java in IntelliJ IDE, focusing on the backend functionalities without a user interface.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-text">
                    Working on this project taught me valuable skills in programming and software design. Even though it was a common project among students, I enjoyed the process of problem-solving and finding solutions for the various functions within the system.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-text">
                    Overall, this project not only enhanced my coding skills but also fueled my passion for software development, encouraging me to explore more complex projects in the future.
